			Hi! I'm Maxx, a second-year Computer Science & Math major at Northeastern in the honors program. I mainly study algorithms and focus on neural networks for machine learning using Tensor. However, I have work experience in full-stack web development and creating apps in Python & Java. Outside of work and academics, I love to play guitar and chess. I've been playing guitar for over 10 years, close to my time in chess where I play as a hobby and on our university's A-Team. I also love interdisciplinary projects, and often delve into psychology and philosophy and try to bridge the gap between the humanities and CS. Feel free to send a message if you'd like to talk more!
