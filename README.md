# Build and Develop

Ensure jekyll is installed via the Ruby gem

- `gem install bundler jekyll`

Once downloaded and repository cloned, develop the site via

- `jekyll build`
- `jekyll serve`

The site utilizes bootstrap via CDN for styling and scripting, and the HTML has been handwritten.
